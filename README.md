## Why

There are two main types of working condition problems for ships. One is the `internal operating working condition` and the other is the `external environment`. 

For the ship, how to reduce fuel consumption under different internal working conditions and how to provide decision-making information for optimization strategies through different working conditions is a work worth studying in depth.

## how


- If there is historical big data as support, it can be analyzed and summarized.

> Produce a `dataset` for subsequent organization and analysis.
- How can new data be processed ?  
> `Machine learning` or `deep learning`.We choose the latter.

### working condition identification dataset
- This dataset contains 98,143 data entries, and the classification of the data is completed through manual annotation.The file is saved in 2024_06_24_14_59_31.mat.
